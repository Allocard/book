## SBT

Six  Soulbound tokens : FD-SBT-001, FD-SBT-002, FD-SBT-003, FD-SBT-004, FD-SBT-005 and FD-SBT-006 , which respectively record the different community activities and data of each full DAO member.

These six SBTs are using ERC20 token standard  and the issuance quantity will be automatically minted and burned by the smart contracts on chain according to each DAO memberâ€™s community activities.

## Introduction of  FireDAO SBTs

|  No. | Name |  Symbol   |  Type  |  SBT Detailed Introduction
| :--: |  :------------:  | :--------: | :---: | -------
|  1.  | FD-SBT-001 | FD-SBT-001 | ERC20 | FD-SBT-001 is one of the comprehensive statistics SBT of FDT holdings. It is mainly used for FDT lock information statistics in the ecosystem. When FDT is locked in different forms, the corresponding proportion of FD-SBT-001 is minted. When the lock-up contract withdraws FDT, the corresponding amount of FD-SBT-001 is burned in the same proportion, and finally the ecological income dividend right is calculated according to the amount of FD-SBT-001 in each Soul Account. The core idea is that DAO is willing to reward users who have a long-term relationship with the ecosystem. The longer the lock-up period, the greater the reward weight.<br><br>FD-SBT-001 has a total of 4 distribution scenarios: <br> (1) Different amounts of FD-SBT-001 are minted and burned according to the quantity and weight during FDT lock-up mining; <br> (2) During FDT Liquidity LP mining, different quantities of FD-SBT-001 are minted and burned according to the quantity and weight; <br> (3) Different amounts of FD-SBT-001 are minted and burned when FLMs are converted into FDTs; <br> (4) Different amounts of FD-SBT-001 are minted and burned during FDT consensus mining.
|  2.  | FD-SBT-002 | FD-SBT-002 | ERC20 | FD-SBT-002 belongs to FLM exchange comprehensive statistical SBT, which is mainly used for ecological contribution statistics. It is used for the combined contribution of each full DAO member to the DAO. 1 FD-SBT-002 will be minted for every 10 FLM exchanged. In the future, DAO will provide special rewards for the holdings of FD-SBT-002. The specific minting  ratio of FD-SBT-002 will be adjusted according to the actual operation situation.
|  3.  | FD-SBT-003 | FD-SBT-003 | ERC20 | FD-SBT-003 is the FireSeed promotion performance comprehensive statistics SBT. When a community member burns a FireSeed to create a FireSoul, his first-level referral will be rewarded with 7 FD-SBT-003 and his second-level referral 2 FD-SBT-003, and the third-level referral 1 FD-SBT-003.The specific minting  ratio of FD-SBT-003 will be adjusted according to the actual operation situation.
|  4.  | FD-SBT-004 | FD-SBT-004 | ERC20 | FD-SBT-004 belongs to the Community Governance Vote Participation Integrated Statistics SBT, and when a full DAO member votes in a community referendum, 100 FD-SBT-004 can be awarded to count his community participation.The specific minting  ratio of FD-SBT-004 will be adjusted according to the actual operation situation.
|  5.  | FD-SBT-005 | FD-SBT-005 | ERC20 | FD-SBT-005 is an FDT Liquidity LP mining comprehensive statistics SBT. The number of minted FD-SBT-005s is determined by the number of LPs and the weighting system when LP is locked. In the case of current lock, 1 LP can be minted to 10 FD-SBT-005s, if locked for 3 months, the weight factor is 3, and 1 LP can be minted to 30 FD-SBT-005s. At the same time, if the lock-up period matures and LPs need to be withdrawn from the mining pool, the same proportion of FD-SBT-005s will be burned according to the proportion of withdrawn LPs.The specific minting  ratio of FD-SBT-005 will be adjusted according to the actual operation situation.
|  6.  | FD-SBT-006 | FD-SBT-006 | ERC20 | FD-SBT-006 is an FDT lock-up mining comprehensive statistics SBT.The minting quantity of FD-SBT-006 is determined by the number and weight coefficient of FDTs included in FDT lock-up. If 10,000 FDTs are locked at this time, lock-up period 3 month, and the weight factor 3, then 30,000 FD-SBT-006s will be minted . If the lock-up matures and FDTs need to be withdrawn from the mining pool, the same proportion of FD-SBT-006 will be burned according to the proportion of FDTs withdrawn in the lock-up order. If the lock-up matures and FDTs are not withdrawn from the lock-up pool, the FDTs will continue to enjoy the benefit of the original policy.
