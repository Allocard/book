# Airdrop

In order to further develop the FID Web3 identity system in a more efficient way, FireDAO will carry out the most extensive airdrop in the history of Web3. FireDAO will first screen active wallet addresses, subsequently determine  airdrop lists, and conduct free FLM airdrops for these  lists.

When a user's wallet address is on the big list and his FID has been minted as well, he can receive 40,000 FLMs, if the FID not minted, he can only receive 4,000 FLMs.

The FLM token received by the airdrop can be exchanged at the official exchange pool for the governance token FDT, which is priced at the real-time price of the secondary market exchange. The simultaneously redeemed FDT is unlocked at the rate of per block and is released linearly for about two years.

FLM airdrops are subject to the referral reward policy. If a wallet with FID receives the airdrop, it will reward his first-level referrer with 4,000 FLMs, his second-level referrer 2,400, and his third-level referrer 1,600. If a wallet without FID receives the airdrop, it will reward his first-level referrer with 400 FLMs, his second-level referrer 240, and his third-level referrer 160.

All FLM quantities involved in rewards will be adjusted or cancelled according to the actual operation.

If a wallet receives 4,000 airdrops first, and then activates the FID, it can no longer reclaim the 36,000 FLMs. It can only invite new users on the airdrop list to receive the airdrop and then get the referral reward.

After the FLMs in the airdrop pool have been collected, the FLMs can continue to be injected into the pool to ensure airdrop continuity.  When the FLMs in the airdrop pool are completely claimed, the new comers can no longer claim the airdrop.
