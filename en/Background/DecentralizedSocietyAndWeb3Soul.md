## Decentralized Society & Web3’s Soul

As of May 10, 2022, Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, E.Glen Weyl with Microsoft Research and Puja Ohlhaver with Flashbots Ltd co-published a Paper named Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul. In this Paper, they invented the concepts of Decentralized Society, Web3 Soul and SoulBound Tokens and triggered a global discussion and impact in the crypto world. Thus, we are inspired by this Paper and decide to launch and create FireDAO, in the hope of initiating a social experiment on Web3’s Soul.

As stated in Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul: Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel financial system with unprecedented flexibility and creativity within a decade. Cryptographic and economic primitives such as public key cryptography, smart contracts, proof of work and proof of stake have led to a sophisticated and open ecosystem for expressing financial transactions.

However, the economic value in financial trades originates from the human relations and interactions. The lack of social narrative makes Web3 fundamentally depend on the extremely centralized Web2 structure.

The lack of a native Web3 identity makes today's DeFi ecosystem unable to support ordinary activities in the real economy, such as undercollateralized lending or simple contracts ,like an apartment lease.

In this paper, they focus on how native Web3 social identities with rich social relationship composability will make great strides in addressing broader long-term problems in Web3 around wealth concentration and governance vulnerability to financial attacks, while simultaneously stimulating the Cambrian explosion with innovative political, economic and social dimensions. They collectively refer to these use cases and the diverse ecosystems as Decentralized Society - DeSoc.

The core of DeSoc are the accounts or wallets holding  non-transferable  Soulbound  tokens (SBTs) which represent commitments, credentials and affiliations. All these will ultimately shape DeSoc's vision - a co-determined sociality.

In this society, most participants have a Soul which stores a series of affiliations, memberships and credentials related to SBTs. Souls and communities gather together from bottom to top to create a diversified network world within a certain social scale.

We highly endorse the ideas of Decentralized Society, Web3’s Soul, and Soulbound Tokens put forward by Vitalik Buterin and others, and it was these ideas that inspired us to initiate and create FireDAO. FireDAO is a social DAO organization  based on FID Soulbound accounts and a community-driven on-chain autonomous economy. We would like to express our deepest respect and heartfelt thanks to thought leaders such as Vitalik Buterin, E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver  and others.
