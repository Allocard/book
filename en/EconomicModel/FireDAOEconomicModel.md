# FireDAO Economic Model

FireDAO implements the 3+1+6 Tokenomics model. There are a total of 10 different types of tokens to maintain the operation and expansion of the entire chain economy in order to  form an automatic, cyclical, endless, on-chain super-economy that practices the true spirit of encryption.

3 refers to three types of ecological tokens: FireDAO Ecological Governance Token FDT,FireDAO Ecological Incentive Token FLM and FireDAO Ecological Identity Token FireSeed.

FDT is the governance token in the FireDAO ecosystem, the core token of the whole ecosystem. It is embedded with the core governance rights of the whole ecosystem and the right to distribute dividends. The whole ecosystem is built around FDT.

FLM is the incentive token in the FireDAO ecosystem to be issued to each participant in the ecosystem in the form of ecological incentives. In the FireDAO ecosystem, FLM can always be exchanged for the governance token FDT at the value of 0.01USD, and the exchanged FDTs will be released linearly at the speed of each block within a period of two years.

FireSeed is the identity token in the whole FireDAO ecosystem, which is used for the threshold of joining DAO and the positioning of recommendation rewards. To join FireDAO, you need to burn 1 FireSeed to generate a Soulbound account FireSoul, and then you become a full member of FireDAO. When a wallet transfers 1 Fireseed to another wallet that has never had any FireSeed before, this wallet can become the recommender of the receiving wallet.

In this way the referrer relations are determined. FireSeed can be obtained in two ways: free airdrop from the FireDAO official team and community members claim it from the Holy Fire Altar. Community members need to donate 100USD for each FireSeed minted.
1 refers to a Soul Account: FireSoul, non-transferable, soul bound. 
FireSoul is the Soul Account of FireDAO. It is minted by burning the identity token FireSeed. Each wallet can only mint one  Soul Account, which is not transferable.This  Soul Account  records the SBT information of different Soulbound tokens owned by this wallet.

As long as a user mints a Soul Account, he can become a full member of FireDAO and each Soul Account will be assigned an FID that represents the On-chain Reputation of the Soul Account. Meanwhile, parameters such as username, social info can be set as comprehensive display page for community members.
6 refers to six Soulbound tokens or SBTs: FD-SBT-001, FD-SBT-002, FD-SBT-003, FD-SBT-004, FD-SBT-005 and FD-SBT-006 , which respectively record the different community activities and data of each full DAO member. These six SBTs are using ERC20 token standard and and the issuance quantity will be automatically minted and burned by the smart contracts on chain according to the different community activities of each DAO full member.
