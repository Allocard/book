# Soulbound Account and FID Reputation System

FireSoul, token type: ERC721, non-transferable, soul bound.

FireSoul is the Soul Account of FireDAO. It is minted by burning the identity token FireSeed. Each wallet can only mint one non-transferable account that records the SBT information of different Soulbound tokens owned by this wallet.

As long as a user mints a Soul Account, he can become a full member of FireDAO and each Soul Account will be assigned a FID that represents the On-chain Reputation of the Soul Account. Meanwhile, parameters such as username, social info can be set as comprehensive display page for community members.Each wallet can mint only one Soul Account and generate one FID, and this account is not transferable. This Soul Account records the SBT information of different Soulbound tokens owned by this wallet.

Different SBTs have different weight coefficients. The comprehensive weight of a Soul Account is calculated by multiplying the number of SBT positions by the weight coefficient. This comprehensive weight also becomes the FID comprehensive credit score of the Soul Account. The comprehensive reputation score of FID determines the voting power of FireDAO and its voting weight of each DAO member.

FireSoul account can be upgraded through community governance in the form of referendum, increasing or decreasing the type of Soulbound token SBT, adjusting the weight coefficient of different Soulbound token SBT, and recalculating the comprehensive reputation score of FID.

The Soul Accounts can be burned and destroyed, and the relationship with the DAO will be cut off. When the account is burned, the Soulbound token SBTs in the account will be burned. After the soul account is burnt,  it is necessary to re-burn a FireSeed to regenerate a new Soul Account.
