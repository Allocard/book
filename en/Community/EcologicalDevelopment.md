# Ecosystem  Extension

FireDAO is a social DAO based on FID Soulbound accounts, a community-driven on-chain autonomous economy. FireDAO takes Soul Account and FID as its core, combines different types of Soulbound tokens, calculates the On-chain Reputation scores , and ultimately builds a native web3 on-chain identity system.

In the first stage of FireDAO's ecological expansion, our core work is to build a Web3 identity system as complete as possible. We hope to exceed 100,000 FireSouls as soon as possible, which will become one of the most influential DAO communities in the world.

As the number of our FIDs continues to expand, our Web3 identity system will  become the underlying  infrastructure of the entire Web3 world. Whether itâ€™s the inside or outside FireDAO ecosystem, any encryption project can integrate our Web3 identity systems, and by the fastest way to integrate FireDAO's  ecosystem members with these Web3 products to create a more transparent and open Web3 ecosystem, which is also the scenario mentioned in the Paper written by Vitalik Buterin and others.

When FireDAO's FID identity system develops to a certain stage, we will continue to expand to the following ecosystems based on the Web3 identity system, including but not limited to:

FID-based decentralized domain name system;

An uncollateralized or partially collateralized loan market based on On-chain Reputation;

Behavioral medal system based on SBTs;

Social recovery system based on SBTs;

NFT soul issuance market based on SBTs;

DAO referendum system based on On-chain Reputation;

Soul airdrop for SBTs;

Diversified assets with SBTs as the main form, manuscripts, real estate, certificates, works of art, etc.

The above are the areas that FireDAO will continue to expand in the future, and we will work together to realize the vision of DeSoc and BitCiv - a co-determined world. In this world, souls can gather with the community bottom up as each other's emerging attributes, and finally build a diverse on-chain society together.
