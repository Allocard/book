# Community Activities

FireDAO is not only a Web3 identity system based on FireSoul and FID, but also a community made up of leaders, creators, builders, believers and supporters who are deeply involved in cryptocurrencies. FireDAO is a social DAO believer in that Web3 will change the world eventually.

Therefore, strengthening the communication and interaction among community members is also our fundamental mission to launch FireDAO. We want to focus on FID and build a well-planned community of like-minded people.

We hope to connect the on-chain identity and off-chain life of each community member by holding various types of activities, so that each community member can meet new people they wonâ€™t meet anywhere else and foster interaction and friendship with one another.

In order to strengthen the communication and interaction between global community members and link the on-chain identity and off-chain life of each DAO member, we will carry out different types of activities online and offline.

Online, we will create Community Ecology Forum to facilitate in-depth communication between community members in different regions of the world. Offline, we will focus on Citynodes carrying out various types of Face to Face activities to create different types of offline communication opportunities for global DAO members as many as possible, which is our intention of creating social DAO.
