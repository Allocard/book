# How to join FireDAO

Joining FireDAO requires no permission and is automatically joined by smart contracts. We will deliver FireSeed in the global Web3 encrytion community. Any community member who owns FireSeed can burn it and mint a FireSoul Account to become an full member of FireDAO.

FireSoul Account is the Soul Account of each full DAO member. It is minted in the form of non-transferable ERC721 and used to store the different Soulbound Tokens received by each DAO member. Each Soulbound Token records different types of community activities and evaluates the community contributions of this DAO member.
