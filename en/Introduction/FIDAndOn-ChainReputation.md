# FID与链上声誉系统

Each Soul Account will be assigned a FID as the on-chain identity ID of the full DAO member, displaying the member’s on-chain identity information, and binding with the Soul Account.

Different SBTs have different weight coefficients. By counting the number and weight coefficients of different Soulbound tokens in the Soul Accounts, each FID will get a comprehensive reputation score to form the On-chain Reputation of the FID.
