# 为什么要创建FireDAO?

In the history of human civilization, no invention has ever had such a tremendous impact on human beings as fire. From drilling fire in the East to Prometheus stealing fire in the West, fire has witnessed each stage of the evolution of human civilization. Fire is one of the most important tangible tools for mankind to achieve civilization. It is said that without fire, there would be no human beings, let alone human civilization.

Fire provides human beings with warmth and light in the dark nights of winter. Food processed with fire is easier for humans to digest and absorb,  and further promotes the development of human brains, which ultimately distinguished humans from animals. Therefore,  fire is the driving force behind human wisdom and brings human beings to enter the era of civilization.

In ancient Greek Mythology, there was no such thing as fire on earth to illuminate or grill food. Humans had to spend lives in endless darkness. Prometheus saw the plight of mankind and decided to steal a tinder from Apollo,  God of the Sun, and brought the world light and warmth.Because of this, Prometheus was punished by Zeus, the Lord of gods, being chained to cliffs of the Caucasus Mountains. Since then he had suffered from hunger, bitter wind, scorching Sun, brutal rain and eagle attacks. It was the fire  stolen by Prometheus that filled human beings  with warmth and light.

## Bible Genesis 1:3:

#### And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, when the Genesis Block of Bitcoin was dug out, an advanced human civilization based on the cornerstone of mathematics and algorithms was born. Human society is bathed in a new light of civilization. This is what we call the Bit Civilization today.

The Bit Civilization is fundamentally different from the existing civilization of human beings and leads to the Web3 world we are exploring today. The Bitcoin created by Satoshi Nakamoto is like the tinder that Prometheus stole, bringing a new light to the evolution of the existing civilization. Satoshi Nakamoto put Bitcoin on the earth, igniting the fire of a civilization full of wisdom.

In our opinion, Bitcoin is the tinder that ignites the Bit Civilization of human beings and the Web3 world we are building now is the soul of this Bit Civilization , and DAO organization is the soul of Web3. In order to keep the civilization fire burning continuously, the more prosperous and longer the burning, the more supply of civilization fuel will be.

The FireDAO that we launched  and created today is the fuel for the fire of civilization. We hope that through the creation and continuation of FireDAO, we can provide a steady stream of fuel for the burning of Bit Civilization and thus inherit wisdom and prosper civilization.
