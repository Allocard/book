# What is FireDAO?

FireDAO is a type of social DAOs founded by a group of Crypto Natives located in Southeast Asia based on FID Soulbound accounts. It is a community-driven on-chain autonomous economy. FireDAO takes Soul Account and FID as the core, combines different types of Soulbound tokens, calculates the On-chain Reputation score, and ultimately builds a native on-chain  Web3 Identity System.

As FireDAO develops to a certain stage, any native Web3 project can integrate FireDAOâ€™s FID identity system, carry out various types of on-chain financial services based on On-chain Reputation, and carry out various types of soul airdrops for FID owners, so that FireDAO's identity system has truly become the infrastructure of the whole Web3 world.
